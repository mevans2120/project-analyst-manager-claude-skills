# Project Progress Log

## Session: 2025-10-17

### Summary
Initial project setup and memory bank implementation for Project Analyst & Manager Claude Code skills.

### Tasks Completed
1. **Project Analysis**
   - Analyzed project planning document
   - Identified two-skill architecture (Analyzer + Manager)
   - Understood phased implementation approach

2. **Documentation Setup**
   - Created CLAUDE.md guidance file
   - Documented project structure and development tasks
   - Specified configuration formats and GitHub integration

3. **Memory Bank Implementation**
   - Set up hybrid memory bank structure
   - Created `.claude-memory/` for automated tracking
   - Created `memory-bank/` for human documentation
   - Initialized session tracking and project architecture files

### Key Insights
- Project requires clear separation between read and write operations
- Duplicate detection will be critical for issue creation
- Phased approach allows for iterative development and testing

### Files Modified
- Created: `CLAUDE.md`
- Created: `.claude-memory/session/current.json`
- Created: `.claude-memory/project/architecture.json`
- Created: `memory-bank/CURRENT.md`
- Created: `memory-bank/progress.md`
- Created: `memory-bank/CHANGELOG.md`
