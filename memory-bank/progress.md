## Session: 2025-10-17 (Continued - Hook Fixes)

### Summary
Fixed hybrid memory bank plugin hooks and prepared Project Analyzer enhancements for commit.

### Tasks Completed
1. **Hook System Debugging**
   - Identified PostToolUse hook error
   - Created backup of existing .claude configuration
   - Uninstalled old hooks

2. **Hook Reinstallation**
   - Copied fresh hooks from ~/hybrid-memory-bank-plugin
   - Installed all hook wrappers: sessionStart.js, userPromptSubmit.js, preToolUse.js, postToolUse.js
   - Copied src/ directory with hook implementations
   - Installed npm dependencies (266 packages)

3. **Hook Testing**
   - Tested SessionStart hook: Successfully displays memory bank status
   - Tested UserPromptSubmit hook: Correctly monitors git changes and provides update instructions
   - Tested PreToolUse hook: Properly filters for git status commands
   - Fixed PostToolUse hook error by creating stub implementation

4. **Project Analyzer Progress**
   - Phase 1 complete: Basic TODO scanning with multiple output formats
   - Phase 1.5 complete: Completion analysis with confidence scoring
   - Archive exclusion feature: Filters TODOs from deprecated directories
   - Tested on codymd-hacknback-main: 1,067 active TODOs (72 likely completed)

### Files Modified
- Deleted: `.claude/` (old configuration)
- Created: `.claude-backup-20251017-164815/` (backup)
- Added: `.claude/settings.json` (hook configuration)
- Added: `.claude/hooks/*.js` (sessionStart, userPromptSubmit, preToolUse, postToolUse, wrapper)
- Added: `src/hooks/*.js` (hook implementations)
- Added: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `node_modules/`
- Modified: `project-analyzer/src/cli.ts` (added --exclude-archives flag)
- Modified: `project-analyzer/src/core/scanner.ts` (added archive filtering)

### Key Insights
- Hybrid memory bank hooks require both wrapper scripts and implementation files
- PostToolUse hook must exist even if it's just a stub to prevent errors
- UserPromptSubmit hook provides proactive memory bank update reminders
- Archive exclusion significantly reduces TODO noise (42.8% reduction)
- Completion analysis helps identify stale TODOs for cleanup

### Next Session Goals
- Commit hook fixes and analyzer enhancements
- Update .gitignore
- Begin Phase 2: Project Manager for GitHub issue creation
- Scan care-tracker-mobile repository

   - Cookie management, API call filtering
   - 19 tests (requires browser installation), 400+ lines of code

4. **PM-4: ScreenshotCapture - Multi-viewport Screenshots**
   - Multi-viewport screenshots (mobile, tablet, desktop, wide)
   - Screenshot comparison functionality
   - Scroll sequence capture
   - File management and batch saving
   - 300+ lines of code

5. **PM-7: Code-Based Feature Discovery**
   - Analyze React routes and components
   - Extract Express API endpoints
   - Parse config files (package.json scripts, dependencies)
   - Auto-discovery of features from codebase
   - 400+ lines of code

### Key Insights
- Dashboard auto-update workflow working perfectly - updates before/during/after each feature
- Parallel implementation (PM-1 + PM-3, PM-4 + PM-7) maximized productivity
- All builds successful, TypeScript compilation clean
- Foundation complete: 3 core shared library components, 2 planner components
- Phase 0 (Shared Library foundation) 50% complete

### Files Modified
**Shared Library**:
- Created: `src/core/WebFetcher.ts` (180 lines)
- Created: `src/core/PlaywrightDriver.ts` (400 lines)
- Created: `src/core/ScreenshotCapture.ts` (300 lines)
- Created: `src/types/playwright.ts`, `src/types/screenshot.ts`
- Created: `tests/WebFetcher.test.ts`, `tests/PlaywrightDriver.test.ts`
- Updated: `package.json` (added playwright, cheerio, turndown, node-fetch)
- Updated: `README.md` (comprehensive documentation)

**Project Planner**:

- PlaywrightDriver enables 6+ downstream features
- CSV format for feature registry allows easy Git versioning
- Code discovery supports React, Express, Next.js, Vue, Angular
- Screenshot capture uses viewport presets for responsive testing

### Next Session Goals
- Implement PM-5: NetworkMonitor (depends on PM-2) ✅ Ready
- Implement PM-6: Feature Extractors (depends on PM-2 + PM-4) ✅ Ready

## Session: 2025-10-21

### Summary
Implemented Dashboard Sync Checker for Project Manager - validates dashboard accuracy and recommends Next Up features based on dependencies.

### Tasks Completed
1. **Dashboard Sync Checker Implementation**
   - Created `src/types/dashboard.ts` with TypeScript interfaces
   - Implemented `src/core/DashboardSync.ts` (350+ lines)
   - Feature validation with confidence scoring (high/medium/low)
   - Dependency graph analysis for Next Up recommendations
   - Detects false positives (marked shipped but incomplete)
   - Identifies completed features not marked as shipped

2. **CLI Integration**
   - Added `check-dashboard` command to CLI
   - Options: --root, --output, --json
   - Exit code indicates dashboard health (0 = up to date, 1 = needs updates)

3. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Created `tests/DashboardSync.test.ts` with 13 tests
   - Tests use REAL feature data from actual dashboard
   - All 53 project-manager tests passing

4. **Feature Planning**
   - Added PM-18: Test Status Dashboard Tab to backlog
   - Created detailed design document `TEST-DASHBOARD-DESIGN.md`
   - Feature will track all tests with run history and pass/fail status
   - Planned 3-phase implementation (data collection, UI, CLI)

### Key Insights
- Dashboard sync checker provides real-time validation of project status
- Dependency-based recommendations help prioritize work
- Using real feature data in tests improves test quality
- Test status dashboard will provide visibility into test suite health
- Jest custom reporter can capture test results without additional tools

### Files Modified
**Created**:
- `project-manager/src/types/dashboard.ts` (TypeScript interfaces)
- `project-manager/src/core/DashboardSync.ts` (validation logic)
- `project-manager/tests/DashboardSync.test.ts` (13 tests)
- `project-manager/TEST-DASHBOARD-DESIGN.md` (planning doc)

**Modified**:
- `project-manager/src/index.ts` (added DashboardSync export and method)
- `project-manager/src/cli.ts` (added check-dashboard command)
- `dashboard/data.js` (added PM-18: Test Status Dashboard Tab)

### Architecture Decisions
- File-based test status storage (`.test-status/` directory)
- Custom Jest reporter for test result capture
- Separate dashboard tab for test health
- Focus on visibility first, enhancements later

### Test Results
- ✅ 53 total tests passing (40 existing + 13 new)
- ✅ DashboardSync validates all 3 shipped features correctly
- ✅ Dependency analysis recommends ready features
- ✅ CLI command works with proper error codes

### Next Session Goals
- Review dashboard sync output on actual project
- Consider implementing test status dashboard
- Continue with backlog features (PM-8, PM-10, PM-12 all ready)
