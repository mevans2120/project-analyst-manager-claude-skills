# Project Progress Log

## Session: 2025-10-17

### Summary
Initial project setup and memory bank implementation for Project Analyst & Manager Claude Code skills.

### Tasks Completed
1. **Project Analysis**
   - Analyzed project planning document
   - Identified two-skill architecture (Analyzer + Manager)
   - Understood phased implementation approach

2. **Documentation Setup**
   - Created CLAUDE.md guidance file
   - Documented project structure and development tasks
   - Specified configuration formats and GitHub integration

3. **Memory Bank Implementation**
   - Set up hybrid memory bank structure
   - Created `.claude-memory/` for automated tracking
   - Created `memory-bank/` for human documentation
   - Initialized session tracking and project architecture files

### Key Insights
- Project requires clear separation between read and write operations
- Duplicate detection will be critical for issue creation
- Phased approach allows for iterative development and testing

### Files Modified
- Created: `CLAUDE.md`
- Created: `.claude-memory/session/current.json`
- Created: `.claude-memory/project/architecture.json`
- Created: `memory-bank/CURRENT.md`
- Created: `memory-bank/progress.md`
- Created: `memory-bank/CHANGELOG.md`
- Created: `memory-bank/ARCHITECTURE.md`

### Next Session Goals
- Create SKILL.md files for both skills
- Begin Phase 1 implementation
- Set up Python project structure
- Implement basic TODO detection

## Session: 2025-10-17 (Continued - Hook Fixes)

### Summary
Fixed hybrid memory bank plugin hooks and prepared Project Analyzer enhancements for commit.

### Tasks Completed
1. **Hook System Debugging**
   - Identified PostToolUse hook error
   - Created backup of existing .claude configuration
   - Uninstalled old hooks

2. **Hook Reinstallation**
   - Copied fresh hooks from ~/hybrid-memory-bank-plugin
   - Installed all hook wrappers: sessionStart.js, userPromptSubmit.js, preToolUse.js, postToolUse.js
   - Copied src/ directory with hook implementations
   - Installed npm dependencies (266 packages)

3. **Hook Testing**
   - Tested SessionStart hook: Successfully displays memory bank status
   - Tested UserPromptSubmit hook: Correctly monitors git changes and provides update instructions
   - Tested PreToolUse hook: Properly filters for git status commands
   - Fixed PostToolUse hook error by creating stub implementation

4. **Project Analyzer Progress**
   - Phase 1 complete: Basic TODO scanning with multiple output formats
   - Phase 1.5 complete: Completion analysis with confidence scoring
   - Archive exclusion feature: Filters TODOs from deprecated directories
   - Tested on codymd-hacknback-main: 1,067 active TODOs (72 likely completed)

### Files Modified
- Deleted: `.claude/` (old configuration)
- Created: `.claude-backup-20251017-164815/` (backup)
- Added: `.claude/settings.json` (hook configuration)
- Added: `.claude/hooks/*.js` (sessionStart, userPromptSubmit, preToolUse, postToolUse, wrapper)
- Added: `src/hooks/*.js` (hook implementations)
- Added: `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `node_modules/`
- Modified: `project-analyzer/src/cli.ts` (added --exclude-archives flag)
- Modified: `project-analyzer/src/core/scanner.ts` (added archive filtering)

### Key Insights
- Hybrid memory bank hooks require both wrapper scripts and implementation files
- PostToolUse hook must exist even if it's just a stub to prevent errors
- UserPromptSubmit hook provides proactive memory bank update reminders
- Archive exclusion significantly reduces TODO noise (42.8% reduction)
- Completion analysis helps identify stale TODOs for cleanup

### Next Session Goals
- Commit hook fixes and analyzer enhancements
- Update .gitignore
- Begin Phase 2: Project Manager for GitHub issue creation
- Scan care-tracker-mobile repository
