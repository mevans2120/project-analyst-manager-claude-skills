# Current Project Status

## Active Development: Project Analyst & Manager Claude Code Skills

### Current Phase
**Phase 1: Basic Analysis & Issue Creation** (Week 1-2)

### What We're Building
Two complementary Claude Code skills to automate project management:
1. **Project Analyzer** - Scans repos for TODOs, specs, and implementation gaps
2. **Project Manager** - Creates issues, organizes docs, generates reports

### Target Repositories
- `codymd-hacknback-main`
- `care-tracker-mobile`

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created project planning document (`project_manager_skill_plan.md`)
- [x] Set up CLAUDE.md guidance file for future Claude instances
- [x] Implemented memory bank structure for project tracking
- [x] Created comprehensive pilot implementation plan (`pilot_implementation_plan.md`)
- [x] Answered all open questions from previous session
- [x] Defined exact Python project structure
- [x] Documented testing strategy
- [x] Created implementation summary for quick reference
- [x] **Implemented Project Analyzer (TypeScript)** - Phase 1 complete
- [x] **Added completion analysis** - Phase 1.5 enhancement
- [x] **Added archive exclusion** - Filter out deprecated TODOs
- [x] **Fixed hybrid memory bank hooks** - All hooks working correctly

### Recent Changes (2025-10-17)
- Reinstalled hybrid memory bank plugin hooks from ~/hybrid-memory-bank-plugin
- Fixed PostToolUse hook error by restoring wrapper and creating implementation
- All hooks tested and working: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse
- Project Analyzer scanned codymd-hacknback-main: 1,067 active TODOs (after archive exclusion)
- Completion analysis identifies 72 likely-completed TODOs for cleanup

### Active Tasks
- [ ] Update .gitignore to exclude node_modules/ and backup directories
- [ ] Commit and push hook fixes and Project Analyzer enhancements
- [ ] Begin Phase 2: Project Manager implementation for GitHub issue creation

### Next Steps
1. Commit current changes (hooks + analyzer enhancements)
2. Update .gitignore for proper exclusions
3. Begin Phase 2 Project Manager implementation
4. Test on care-tracker-mobile repository

### Key Decisions Made (Updated)
- Using phased implementation approach (3 phases over 6 weeks)
- Separating read-only (Analyzer) from write operations (Manager)
- JSON state tracking with SHA256 hashing to prevent duplicate issue creation
- Structured labeling system with category, priority, and source labels
- **Python standalone scripts** (not plugin) for flexibility
- Test repository approach before production deployment
- Fuzzy string matching for duplicate detection (75% similarity threshold)
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and logging

### Questions Resolved
- ✓ Exact Python project structure: Defined with analyzer/, manager/, shared/ modules
- ✓ Integration method: Standalone Python scripts callable from Claude Code
- ✓ Testing strategy: Unit tests + integration tests + test repository approach
- ✓ Duplicate prevention: State tracking + similarity detection
- ✓ Configuration approach: config.json + .env for credentials
- ✓ Report format: Markdown reports in docs/reports/
- ✓ State persistence: .project-state.json per repository

### Resources & Links
- Planning Doc: `project_manager_skill_plan.md`
- **Implementation Plan**: `pilot_implementation_plan.md` (comprehensive, step-by-step guide)
- **Quick Reference**: `IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md` (condensed overview)
- Target Repo 1: `codymd-hacknback-main`
- Target Repo 2: `care-tracker-mobile`
- Test Repo: `project-manager-test-repo` (to be created)

### Key Documents Created

   - Day-by-day breakdown for 2 weeks
   - Complete code examples for all modules
   - Testing strategies and checklists
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
   - Rollback procedures
   - Success metrics
   - Integration with Claude Code
   - Phase 2 planning

2. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md**:
