# Current Project Status

## Active Development: Project Analyst & Manager Claude Code Skills

### Current Phase
**Phase 1: Basic Analysis & Issue Creation** (Week 1-2)

### What We're Building
Two complementary Claude Code skills to automate project management:
1. **Project Analyzer** - Scans repos for TODOs, specs, and implementation gaps
2. **Project Manager** - Creates issues, organizes docs, generates reports

### Target Repositories
- `codymd-hacknback-main`
- `care-tracker-mobile`

### Completed Tasks
- [x] Created project planning document (`project_manager_skill_plan.md`)
- [x] Set up CLAUDE.md guidance file for future Claude instances
- [x] Implemented memory bank structure for project tracking
- [x] Created comprehensive pilot implementation plan (`pilot_implementation_plan.md`)
- [x] Answered all open questions from previous session
- [x] Defined exact Python project structure
- [x] Documented testing strategy
- [x] Created implementation summary for quick reference

### Next Steps
1. Begin Day 1 implementation:
   - Set up Python project structure
   - Create test repository on GitHub
   - Configure GitHub authentication
   - Initialize virtual environment and dependencies
2. Follow day-by-day implementation guide in `pilot_implementation_plan.md`
3. Complete Week 1 (Days 1-5) to achieve working MVP
4. Test on production repositories in Week 2

### Key Decisions Made (Updated)
- Using phased implementation approach (3 phases over 6 weeks)
- Separating read-only (Analyzer) from write operations (Manager)
- JSON state tracking with SHA256 hashing to prevent duplicate issue creation
- Structured labeling system with category, priority, and source labels
- **Python standalone scripts** (not plugin) for flexibility
- Test repository approach before production deployment
- Fuzzy string matching for duplicate detection (75% similarity threshold)
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and logging

### Questions Resolved
- ✓ Exact Python project structure: Defined with analyzer/, manager/, shared/ modules
- ✓ Integration method: Standalone Python scripts callable from Claude Code
- ✓ Testing strategy: Unit tests + integration tests + test repository approach
- ✓ Duplicate prevention: State tracking + similarity detection
- ✓ Configuration approach: config.json + .env for credentials
- ✓ Report format: Markdown reports in docs/reports/
- ✓ State persistence: .project-state.json per repository

   - Complete code examples for all modules
   - Testing strategies and checklists
   - Risk assessment and mitigation
