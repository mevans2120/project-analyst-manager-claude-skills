# Current Project Status

## Active Development: Complete Project Management Suite (3 Claude Code Skills)

### Current Phase
**Phase 1 & 1.5: Complete** âœ…
**Phase 2: Planning** (Project Planner skill design complete)

### What We're Building
Three complementary Claude Code skills for complete project management:
1. **Project Analyzer** (PRODUCTION âœ…) - Scans repos for TODOs, specs, and implementation gaps
2. **Project Manager** (PRODUCTION âœ…) - Creates issues, organizes docs, generates reports
3. **Project Planner** (DESIGN PHASE ðŸ“‹) - Feature registry, blue sky planning, web viewing

### Recent Changes (2025-10-21)
- **Enhanced Project Analyzer with context-aware descriptions**:
  - Track section headings in planning docs to clarify ambiguous items
  - "Firefox" â†’ "Firefox browser compatibility" with section context
- **Added configuration task validation**:
  - Detects "X added to Y" patterns (e.g., ".env added to .gitignore")
  - Validates file contents (100% confidence when verified)
  - Reduces false negatives for config tasks
- **Contextual explanations for missing features**:
  - Replaced generic file suggestions with task-specific guidance
  - 9 task categories: config, maintenance, testing, docs, infrastructure, UI, API, state
  - 3-4 sentence explanations tailored to each task type
- **Build artifact filtering**:
  - Exclude dist/ directories from reports (prevents minified code bloat)
  - Report size: 828KB â†’ 7.7KB
- **Project Planner skill design complete**:
  - 6 design documents (~34,000 words)
  - Blue sky + existing codebase support
  - CSV-based feature registry
  - Web viewing capability (WebFetch + Playwright + Screenshot AI)
  - 3-phase implementation roadmap (7-10 weeks)
  - Integration architecture with Analyzer and Manager

### Previous Changes (2025-10-17)
- Reinstalled hybrid memory bank plugin hooks from ~/hybrid-memory-bank-plugin
- Fixed PostToolUse hook error by restoring wrapper and creating implementation
- All hooks tested and working: SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse
- Project Analyzer scanned codymd-hacknback-main: 1,067 active TODOs (after archive exclusion)
- Completion analysis identifies 72 likely-completed TODOs for cleanup

### Active Tasks
- [ ] Begin Project Planner implementation (Phase 1: Core functionality)
- [ ] Test enhanced feature detection on additional codebases
- [ ] Create demo videos for all three skills

### Next Steps
1. **Project Planner Phase 1** (2-3 weeks):
   - CSV registry + validation
   - Manual feature entry CLI
   - Basic auto-discovery (React + Express)
   - Markdown roadmap export
2. **Integration & Testing**:
   - Connect Planner â†’ Analyzer â†’ Manager workflow
   - Test on real projects (blue sky + existing)
3. **Documentation & Examples**:
   - Update quickstart guides
   - Create video demos
   - Gather user feedback

### Key Decisions Made (Updated)
- Using phased implementation approach (3 phases over 6 weeks)
- Separating read-only (Analyzer) from write operations (Manager)
- JSON state tracking with SHA256 hashing to prevent duplicate issue creation
- Structured labeling system with category, priority, and source labels
- **Python standalone scripts** (not plugin) for flexibility
- Test repository approach before production deployment
- Fuzzy string matching for duplicate detection (75% similarity threshold)
- Comprehensive error handling with retry logic and logging

### Questions Resolved
- âœ“ Exact Python project structure: Defined with analyzer/, manager/, shared/ modules
- âœ“ Integration method: Standalone Python scripts callable from Claude Code
- âœ“ Testing strategy: Unit tests + integration tests + test repository approach
- âœ“ Duplicate prevention: State tracking + similarity detection
- âœ“ Configuration approach: config.json + .env for credentials
- âœ“ Report format: Markdown reports in docs/reports/
- âœ“ State persistence: .project-state.json per repository
