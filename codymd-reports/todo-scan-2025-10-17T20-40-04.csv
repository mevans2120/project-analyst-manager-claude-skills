TODO Section,medium,"**1. Remove from Type Definitions**

- [ ] `/src/types/index.ts` (line 40)
  ```typescript
  // REMOVE THIS LINE:
  isOverdue?: boolean // Is the task pending/in-progress AND past due
  ```

- [ ] `/src/lib/mobile-sdk/types.ts` (line 99)
  ```typescript
  // REMOVE THIS LINE:
  isOverdue?: boolean // Is the task pending/in-progress AND past due
  ```

**2. Remove from TaskTranslator**

- [ ] `/src/lib/api/translators/TaskTranslator.ts` (lines 159-190)

  **Before:**
  ```typescript
  private static calculateTimelineFields(scheduledTime: Date, procedureDate: Date, status?: string): {
    weekNumber: number;
    postOpDay: number;
    dayOfWeek: string;
    isPast: boolean;
    isOverdue: boolean; // REMOVE THIS
  } {
    // ... existing code ...
    const isOverdue = isPast && (status === 'pending' || status === 'in-progress'); // REMOVE THIS

    return {
      weekNumber,
      postOpDay,
      dayOfWeek,
      isPast,
      isOverdue // REMOVE THIS
    };
  }
  ```

  **After:**
  ```typescript
  private static calculateTimelineFields(scheduledTime: Date, procedureDate: Date, status?: string): {
    weekNumber: number;
    postOpDay: number;
    dayOfWeek: string;
    isPast: boolean;
  } {
    // ... existing code (keep as-is) ...

    return {
      weekNumber,
      postOpDay,
      dayOfWeek,
      isPast
    };
  }
  ```

**3. Keep Helper Methods (No Changes Needed)**

- [ ] `/src/lib/api/translators/NotificationTranslator.ts` (line 236)
  - **Keep as-is** - This is a static helper method for checking notification overdue status
  - Not part of API response, used internally only

- [ ] `/src/lib/api/translators/MilestoneTranslator.ts` (line 223)
  - **Keep as-is** - This is a static helper method for checking milestone overdue status
  - Not part of API response, used internally only

**4. Update API Documentation**

- [ ] `/src/app/api/mobile/v1/README.md` (lines 138, 156, 185)
  - Remove `isOverdue` from example JSON responses
  - Remove from field documentation list
  - Update any references to overdue task filtering

**5. Testing Checklist**

- [ ] Verify web app still compiles (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Verify no TypeScript errors
- [ ] Test timeline view displays correctly
- [ ] Test task completion flows work
- [ ] Test mobile API endpoints return valid responses
- [ ] Verify mobile SDK types compile
- [ ] Run existing test suites","docs/REFACTORING_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md",40
