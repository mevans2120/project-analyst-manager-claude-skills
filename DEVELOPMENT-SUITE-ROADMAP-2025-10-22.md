# Development Suite - Roadmap

**Status**: Planning / Not Started
**Date**: 2025-10-22
**Purpose**: Companion suite to Project Suite focused on code quality, testing, and implementation excellence

---

## Overview

The **Development Suite** provides Claude Code skills for ensuring high-quality code implementation:

- **Quality Assurance**: Test generation, coverage analysis, verification
- **Code Quality**: Linting, refactoring, performance optimization
- **Implementation**: Code generation, scaffolding, boilerplate reduction

This complements:
- **Project Suite** (this repo): Project management, planning, tracking
- **Design Suite** (separate): UI/UX, architecture, design patterns

---

## Planned Skills

### 1. QA/Testing Skill (Priority 1)

**Purpose**: Automated test generation and verification with focus on quality over quantity

**Core Capabilities**:
- Analyze test coverage gaps (identify untested code by risk)
- Generate high-quality tests (integration-first, minimal mocking)
- Run test suites and verify results
- Suggest improvements and fixes for failures

**Philosophy**:
- ‚úÖ Fewer, better tests that verify real behavior
- ‚úÖ Integration tests > unit tests (when possible)
- ‚úÖ Test with real data, avoid mocks unless necessary
- ‚úÖ Focus on critical paths and edge cases

**Features**:
- **Coverage Gap Analysis**: Function/branch coverage, integration points, critical paths
- **Intelligent Test Generation**: Prefer integration, avoid mocks, include edge cases
- **Test Execution**: Run Jest/Playwright/Vitest, parse results, verify coverage
- **E2E Scenario Planning**: Generate user journeys from feature specs
- **Regression Suite Management**: Identify critical tests, prevent regressions

**Technologies**:
- Jest for unit/integration tests
- Playwright for E2E browser tests
- Istanbul/NYC for coverage reporting
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

---

### 2. Code Quality Skill (Future)

**Purpose**: Maintain code quality standards

**Capabilities**:
- Linting and formatting
- Code smell detection
- Refactoring suggestions
- Performance analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning

---

### 3. Code Generation Skill (Future)

**Purpose**: Accelerate implementation with smart code generation

**Capabilities**:
- Scaffold new features from specs
- Generate boilerplate code
- Create TypeScript types from APIs
- Generate data fixtures for tests

---

## Implementation Timeline

**Phase 1**: QA/Testing Skill (after Project Suite Phase 1 complete)
**Phase 2**: Code Quality enhancements
**Phase 3**: Code Generation and scaffolding

---

## Integration with Project Suite

The Development Suite will integrate with Project Suite:

```
Analyzer (finds features) ‚Üí QA Skill (generates tests)
Manager (creates issues) ‚Üí QA Skill (verifies fixes)
Planner (tracks features) ‚Üí QA Skill (ensures test coverage)
```

---

## Why Separate Suite?

**Separation of Concerns**:
- Project Suite = Project management (WHAT, WHEN, WHY)
- Development Suite = Code quality (HOW, HOW WELL)
- Design Suite = Architecture/UX (HOW IT SHOULD WORK/LOOK)

Each suite focuses on its core competency, avoiding bloat.

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Complete Project Suite Phase 1
2. ‚è∏Ô∏è  Document Development Suite roadmap (this doc)
3. üîú Manually write tests for Project Suite (PM-50+)
4. üîú Build QA Skill when ready (after sufficient test-writing experience)

---

## Notes

- Don't build prematurely - learn from manual testing first
- QA skill should automate what we learn from writing tests ourselves
- Keep it simple - build only what we actually need
