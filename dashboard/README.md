# Interactive Product Roadmap Dashboard

**A feature-first, priority-driven project tracking dashboard with interactive feature management**

## Quick Start

1. **Open the dashboard in Chrome or Edge**:
   ```bash
   open dashboard/index.html
   ```
   Or double-click `index.html` in Finder

   **Browser Requirements**: Chrome or Edge (File System Access API required for interactive features)

2. **Connect to data.js** (one-time per session):
   - Click the **"üìÇ Connect File for Auto-Save"** banner at the top
   - Select `dashboard/data.js` in the file picker
   - Grant permission when prompted

3. **Manage features interactively**:
   - **Drag-and-drop** any Backlog feature to the Next Up section to promote it
   - Click **"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start This Feature"** on any Next Up feature to move it to Current
   - Changes auto-save to `data.js` - no copy/paste needed!

4. **Bookmark it** in your browser for quick access

That's it!

## Interactive Features

### Drag-and-Drop & Click Controls

**Backlog ‚Üí Next Up** (Drag-and-Drop):
- **Grab** any Backlog feature (look for the ‚úã drag hint)
- **Drag** it over to the Next Up section
- **Drop** it when the section highlights in blue
- Dashboard validates dependencies automatically
- If dependencies are not met, shows alert with missing items
- If dependencies are met, feature moves to Next Up
- Changes save immediately to `data.js`

**Next Up ‚Üí Current** (Click):
- Click **"‚ñ∂Ô∏è Start This Feature"** button on any Next Up feature
- Feature automatically moves to Current and In Progress
- Progress starts at 0%
- Changes save immediately to `data.js`

### Auto-Save

- Uses **File System Access API** for direct file writes
- No copy/paste needed
- Preserves exact file format
- Changes take effect immediately

**Session-Based Connection**:
- File connection is stored in memory (not localStorage)
- You'll need to reconnect after browser restart, tab close, or page refresh
- This is a security feature of the File System Access API

### Dependency Validation

Example: Cannot move PM-2 to Next Up if PM-1 is not shipped:

```javascript
{
  id: "shared-playwright",
  number: 2,
  dependencies: ["shared-webfetcher"]  // PM-1 must be shipped first
}
```

If you try to move this feature too early:
```
‚ùå Cannot move to Next Up. Dependencies not met: shared-webfetcher
```

**Solution**: Complete PM-1 first, or remove the dependency from the feature.

## How to Update (Manual Editing)

You can also edit `data.js` manually if you prefer:

### When You Start a New Feature

**Example**: Starting WebFetcher

Edit `data.js`:

```javascript
// 1. Move from nextUp to inProgress
inProgress: [
  {
    id: "shared-webfetcher",
    name: "WebFetcher - Static HTML Analysis",
    category: "Shared Library",
    priority: "P0",
    progress: 0,  // Start at 0%
    blockers: [],
    value: "Foundation for all web viewing",
    notes: "Building core fetch and AI analysis capabilities"
  }
],

// 2. Remove from nextUp
nextUp: [
  // Remove the WebFetcher entry
  {
    id: "shared-playwright", // This is now first in nextUp
    // ...
  }
],

// 3. Also add to current array
current: [
  {
    id: "shared-webfetcher",
    name: "WebFetcher - Static HTML Analysis",
    category: "Shared Library",
    priority: "P0",
    progress: 0,
    blockers: [],
    value: "Foundation for all web viewing",
    notes: "Building core fetch and AI analysis capabilities"
  }
],
```

Save and refresh browser.

### As You Make Progress

**Example**: WebFetcher is 40% done

Edit `data.js`:

```javascript
current: [
  {
    id: "shared-webfetcher",
    name: "WebFetcher - Static HTML Analysis",
    category: "Shared Library",
    priority: "P0",
    progress: 40,  // Update progress
    blockers: [],
    value: "Foundation for all web viewing",
    notes: "fetch() working, added AI analysis, 15 tests passing"
  }
],
```

Save and refresh browser.

### When You Finish a Feature

**Example**: WebFetcher is done!

Edit `data.js`:

```javascript
// 1. Move from inProgress to shipped
shipped: [
  {
    id: "shared-webfetcher",
    name: "WebFetcher - Static HTML Analysis",
    category: "Shared Library",
    shippedDate: "2025-11-01",  // Add ship date
    value: "Foundation for all web viewing - 25 tests passing"
  },
  // ...other shipped features
],

// 2. Remove from inProgress
inProgress: [],  // Now empty

// 3. Remove from current
current: [],  // Ready for next feature!
```

Save and refresh browser.

### Adding a New Feature

**Example**: Discovered a new feature to build

Edit `data.js`:

```javascript
backlog: [
  {
    id: "new-feature-id",  // Use kebab-case
    name: "Descriptive Feature Name",
    category: "Planner",  // or Analyzer, Manager, Shared Library, etc.
    priority: "P2",  // P0 (critical), P1 (high), P2 (medium), P3 (low)
    dependencies: ["other-feature-id"],  // What must be done first
    value: "Why this matters - what value it provides"
  },
  // ...other backlog features
]
```

Save and refresh browser.

## Dashboard Sections Explained

### 1. üöÄ Current
**What it shows**: The feature(s) you're actively building RIGHT NOW

**When to update**:
- Start: Move feature from nextUp to current
- Progress: Update the `progress` field (0-100)
- Finish: Move to shipped

**Tip**: Keep only 1-2 features in current. Focus!

### 2. üì¶ All Features
**What it shows**: All features organized by status

**Categories**:
- ‚úÖ **Shipped**: Done, in production
- üèóÔ∏è **In Progress**: Currently building
- üîú **Next Up**: Ready to start (no blockers)
- üìã **Backlog**: Future work

**Tip**: Drag features between categories by editing data.js

### 3. ‚ö° Priority Queue
**What it shows**: What to work on next, in priority order

**When to update**:
- Weekly review of priorities
- When dependencies change
- When new blockers appear

**Tip**: This answers "What should I work on next?"

### 4. üé¨ Quick Actions
**What it shows**: Links to important resources

**Customize**: Edit the links in index.html if needed

## File Structure

```
dashboard/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html    # Dashboard UI (rarely changes)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data.js       # Your data (update weekly)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md     # This file
```

**What to edit**: Almost always just `data.js`

**What NOT to edit**: `index.html` (unless you want to customize the UI)

## Data Structure Reference

### Feature Object

```javascript
{
  id: "unique-kebab-case-id",           // Required: Unique identifier
  name: "Human Readable Feature Name",  // Required: What shows in UI

## Common Workflows

### Weekly Review (Monday, 5 minutes)

1. **Check current**: How much progress?
   - Update `progress` field
   - Update `notes` with status

2. **Finish features**: Any features done?
   - Move to `shipped`
   - Add `shippedDate`

3. **Start next**: What's next?
   - Check priority queue
   - Move from `nextUp` to `current`

4. **Adjust priorities**: Anything change?
   - Reorder `priorityQueue`
   - Update `dependencies`

Save, refresh, done!

### Feature Lifecycle

```

## Tips & Best Practices

### Focus
- ‚úÖ Keep 1-2 features in `current` max
- ‚úÖ Finish before starting new ones
- ‚ùå Don't spread across too many features

### Dependencies
- ‚úÖ List dependencies clearly
- ‚úÖ Only move to `nextUp` when dependencies are in `shipped`
- ‚úÖ Use `priorityQueue` to plan order

### Progress Updates
- ‚úÖ Update weekly (or when milestones hit)
- ‚úÖ Be honest about progress
- ‚ùå Don't obsess over exact percentages

### Priorities
- ‚úÖ Use P0 for critical blockers
- ‚úÖ Use P1 for must-haves
- ‚úÖ Use P2-P3 for nice-to-haves
- ‚ùå Don't make everything P0

### Value Statements
- ‚úÖ Explain WHY this matters
- ‚úÖ What problem does it solve?
- ‚úÖ Who benefits?
- ‚ùå Don't just describe WHAT it does

## Customization

### Change Colors

Edit the `<style>` section in `index.html`:

```css
/* Primary color (currently blue) */
--primary: #58a6ff;

/* Success color (currently green) */
--success: #3fb950;

/* Warning color (currently orange) */
--warning: #d29922;

/* Danger color (currently red) */
--danger: #f85149;
```

### Add Sections

Add new sections in `index.html` after the existing sections:

```html
<!-- 5. YOUR NEW SECTION -->
<div class="section">
  <h2>üé® Your Section</h2>
  <div id="your-section"></div>
</div>
```

Then add rendering logic in the `<script>` tag.

### Change Layout

Modify the CSS grid, flexbox, or spacing in the `<style>` section.

## Troubleshooting

### Dashboard shows "Loading..."
- **Problem**: JavaScript not loading
- **Fix**: Make sure `data.js` is in the same folder as `index.html`

### Features not showing
- **Problem**: Syntax error in `data.js`
- **Fix**: Check browser console (F12) for errors
- **Common**: Missing comma, extra comma, unclosed brackets

### "File System Access API not supported in this browser"
- **Problem**: Using Firefox or Safari
- **Fix**: Switch to Chrome or Edge for interactive features
- **Alternative**: Edit `data.js` manually (interactive features not required)

### Changes don't persist after page refresh
- **Problem**: File connection lost (session-based)
- **Fix**: Click "üìÇ Select data.js File" to reconnect
- **Why**: Security feature of File System Access API

### "Cannot move to Next Up. Dependencies not met"
- **Problem**: Trying to move a feature that depends on unfinished features
- **Fix Option 1**: Complete and ship the dependent features first
- **Fix Option 2**: Edit `data.js` to remove dependencies from the feature
- **Example**: PM-2 depends on PM-1, so PM-1 must be shipped before PM-2 can move to Next Up

### Drag-and-drop not working
- **Problem**: Can't drag backlog features
- **Fix**:
  1. Ensure you're using Chrome or Edge (drag-and-drop uses modern APIs)
  2. Look for the ‚úã drag hint on backlog features
  3. Try refreshing the page (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)
  4. Make sure you're not holding down Ctrl/Cmd while dragging

### File doesn't save / Changes not applying
- **Problem**: File handle lost or file locked
- **Fix**:
  1. Check browser console (F12) for error messages
  2. Ensure you selected the correct `data.js` file
  3. Ensure file is not open/locked by another program (close VS Code, etc.)
  4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting to the file

### Styles look broken
- **Problem**: Browser cache
- **Fix**: Hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R on Mac, Ctrl+Shift+R on Windows)

### Need to reset
- **Problem**: Messed up data.js
- **Fix**: Git restore: `git checkout dashboard/data.js`

## Future Enhancements

When you feel pain from not having these, add them:

### Auto-Generate from Git
```bash
npm run dashboard:update
# Reads git log, updates shipped dates
```

### Export to JSON
```bash
npm run dashboard:export
# Creates roadmap.json for other tools
```

### Use Planner to Manage Itself
```bash
planner dashboard --live
# Dashboard becomes a Planner feature
```

But not now. Keep it simple until you need more.

## Philosophy

**This dashboard follows these principles**:

1. **Features > Time** - Focus on what's built, not when
2. **Priority > Schedule** - Focus on what matters most
3. **Value > Velocity** - Focus on impact, not speed
4. **Simple > Complex** - Two files, manual updates, no build
5. **Flexible > Rigid** - Adapt as AI changes timelines

**The Rule**: Only add features when you feel actual pain from not having them.

---

## Questions?

- **How often should I update?** Weekly is fine. Daily if you want.
- **What if I don't know progress %?** Guess! 0% = started, 50% = halfway, 100% = done
- **Can I track time?** You can, but we don't recommend it. Focus on features.
- **Should I add every tiny task?** No. Only features that provide user value.
- **What if estimates are wrong?** That's fine! This isn't about estimates.

Remember: This is a roadmap, not a schedule. Ship when ready, not by deadline.
