## Resource Allocation

### Developers Needed

**Option 1: Single Developer (15 weeks)**
- Solo developer works sequentially
- Advantages: Consistency, deep context
- Timeline: 15 weeks as shown

**Option 2: Two Developers (8-10 weeks)**
- Dev 1: Shared Library (4 weeks) → Planner (6 weeks)
- Dev 2: Analyzer enhancement (6 weeks) → Manager enhancement (6 weeks)
- Overlap: Weeks 5-10
- Timeline: 10 weeks total

**Option 3: Three Developers (6-8 weeks)**
- Dev 1: Shared Library (4 weeks) → Integration (2 weeks)
- Dev 2: Planner (10 weeks from start, but uses shared lib after week 4)
- Dev 3: Analyzer (8 weeks from week 4) + Manager (6 weeks from week 8)
- Timeline: 8 weeks total with parallelization

---

## Risk Mitigation

### Risk 1: Shared Library Delays
**Impact**: Blocks all web viewing features
**Mitigation**:
- Prioritize core components (Weeks 1-2)
- Allow skills to proceed with code-only features
- Phase web viewing as enhancements

### Risk 2: Playwright Complexity
**Impact**: Web discovery accuracy issues
**Mitigation**:
- Start with WebFetch (simpler)
- Add Playwright incrementally
- Include interactive auth mode for complex cases

### Risk 3: Integration Issues
**Impact**: Skills don't work together seamlessly
**Mitigation**:
- Define clear contracts early (features.csv schema)
- Integration tests at each milestone
- Weekly integration check-ins

### Risk 4: Performance Problems
**Impact**: Slow web viewing, timeouts
**Mitigation**:
- Parallel screenshot capture
- Caching strategies
- Configurable timeouts
- Rate limiting

---

## Success Criteria
