# Project Suite Claude Skills

**Production-ready Claude Code skills for automated project management**

Analyze TODOs, extract features from designs and websites, verify production deployments, and create GitHub issues‚Äîall through natural conversation with Claude Code.

---

## What This Does

Three powerful skills that work together to automate your project management workflow:

### üîç **Project Analyzer**
- Scan repositories for TODOs, FIXMEs, and task lists
- Detect likely-completed tasks with confidence scoring
- Analyze design files and websites to extract feature lists
- Verify features work in production (3-tier verification)
- Generate comprehensive analysis reports

### üìã **Project Manager**
- Create GitHub issues from TODOs automatically
- Smart label management and duplicate prevention
- Visual testing with multi-viewport screenshots
- Before/after comparison and UI bug detection
- Daily reports and state tracking

### üó∫Ô∏è **Project Planner**
- Discover features from React/Express codebases
- Extract features from live websites
- Maintain feature registry in CSV format
- Generate roadmaps grouped by phase/priority
- Track implementation status and dependencies

---

## Installation

### One-Line Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mevans2120/project-suite-claude-skills.git
cd project-suite-claude-skills
./install.sh
```

The installation script will:
- ‚úÖ Check prerequisites (Node.js, npm)
- ‚úÖ Build all packages automatically
- ‚úÖ Install Playwright browsers
- ‚úÖ Copy tools to `~/.project-suite/`
- ‚úÖ Install skills to `~/.claude/skills/`
- ‚úÖ Configure everything for global use

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 18+ and **npm**
- **Claude Code** ([claude.com/code](https://claude.com/code))
- **GitHub CLI** (optional, for issue creation): `gh auth login`

---

## Quick Start

After installation, just ask Claude naturally:

### Analyze TODOs
```
"Analyze the TODOs in this project"
"Find all FIXMEs and generate a cleanup report"
```

### Extract Features from Designs
```
"Analyze the design files in ./designs and export to CSV"
"Extract features from https://example.com"
```

### Verify Production
```
"Verify the login feature works in production"
"Compare staging vs production deployment"
```

### Create GitHub Issues
```
"Create GitHub issues from these TODOs"
"Generate a project status report"
```

### Discover Features from Code
```
"Discover all features in my React app"
"Generate a roadmap from the codebase"
```

Claude will automatically invoke the appropriate skill and handle everything!

---

## How It Works

The skills integrate seamlessly with Claude Code:

1. **You ask** Claude to analyze, verify, or create issues
2. **Claude invokes** the appropriate skill automatically
3. **Skills run** analysis, extraction, or verification
4. **Results appear** in your project directory
5. **Claude summarizes** findings and suggests next steps

Skills are **model-invoked**‚ÄîClaude decides when to use them based on your conversation. No manual commands needed.

## Example Workflows

### Workflow 1: Feature Discovery Pipeline
```
1. "Analyze design files in ./designs" ‚Üí Extract 42 features
2. "Discover features from my React code" ‚Üí Find 38 implemented features
3. "Compare the lists and create issues for gaps" ‚Üí Create 4 GitHub issues
4. "Generate a roadmap from the feature registry" ‚Üí Roadmap.md created
```

### Workflow 2: Production Verification
```
1. "Analyze TODOs marked as completed" ‚Üí Find 15 completed tasks
2. "Verify they work in production" ‚Üí 3-tier verification runs
3. "Create issues for failed verifications" ‚Üí 2 bugs found, issues created
4. "Capture screenshots of the failures" ‚Üí Visual evidence attached
```

### Workflow 3: Sprint Planning
```
1. "Scan the codebase for all TODOs" ‚Üí Find 67 tasks
2. "Filter high-priority items" ‚Üí 12 critical tasks
3. "Create GitHub issues with labels" ‚Üí Issues created with auto-labels
4. "Generate sprint report" ‚Üí Status report with statistics
```

## Configuration

### GitHub Authentication

For issue creation (project-manager):
```bash
gh auth login
# or
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token"
```

### Project Manager Config

Create `project-manager.config.json`:
```json
{
  "repositories": [
    {
      "name": "my-repo",
      "owner": "username",
      "planningPaths": ["docs", "planning"]
    }
  ],
  "github": {
    "defaultLabels": ["auto-created"],
    "issueTitlePrefix": "[PM]"
  }
}
```

See `.claude/skills/QUICKSTART.md` for detailed examples.
